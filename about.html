        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Rivendell Gardens is a dream of ours.  We love nature and protecting the environment. 
          We want to grow trees that not only provide oxygen, shade, aesthetic beauty, but also produce delicious edible fruits.  
          Currently we are planting fruit trees on our farm and we are in the process of preparing a tropical fruit trees nursery which will be opened to the public on Saturday and
          Sundays (coming soon).  We do sell our grafted fruit trees from Riverview and Lake Wales.  Just email us and you can come by to pick them up. 
          Our fruit trees are grafted or air layered.  Some have fruits already and others will fruit within 1-2 years. 
              Our goal is to share the exotic trees and fruits to everyone at a great price. 
              Soon we will build a Japanese Garden with Koi ponds where you all can tour and enjoy it as much as we do.</p>
