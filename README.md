## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

First step was to define the purpose and goals of the website. Determine what information and features the client wanted to include, such as plant databases, gardening tips, and a user-friendly interface.
then create wireframes or mockups to visualize the layout and design of the website. From there, I was able to continue to add features and details to finalize the project.

## Optimizations

Given more time I would optimize content delivery to prioritize critical content over non-essential elements to ensure a smooth user experience, especially for users with slower connections.

## Lessons Learned:

Throughout this experience, near the end I learned SEO is Fundamental by understanding and implementing basic Search Engine Optimization (SEO) principles can greatly improve discoverability and visibility on search engines.
